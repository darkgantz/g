    <name>Post Event Internal Survey</name>
    <style>freeForm</style>
    <subject>We would like your opinion on TE # {!Training_Event__c.Training_Event_Number__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>In an effort to capture more information about our Trainers, we created a survey for you to fill out on the Trainer. Please fill this form out AFTER you have spoken with the client.

{!Training_Event__c.Link} 
Hover over the &quot;Training Event Internal Surveys&quot; link at the top of the Training Event page, then click on the &quot;New Training Event Internal Surveys&quot; button to fill out the survey.
 
The first section of the form is from YOUR perspective and the second section is based on the feedback from the CLIENT. 

We can report on this feedback by Trainer, Client and Rep so we can see trends and it will be helpful in making future decisions about trainers on your Training Events.
 
Please take the time to fill this out as accurately as possible.  
**Hover over the yellow &quot;?&quot; icons to see a full description of the question.</textOnly>
